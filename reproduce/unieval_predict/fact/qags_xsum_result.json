Police said three armed men took a five-figure sum from the vehicle in the city 's sauchiehall street on monday at about 21:45 . A spokesman said no-one had been injured although two security guards aged 47 and 49 were left badly shaken . The area around the bank , which is near the buchanan galleries shopping centre , has been cordoned off by police . Police said the security guards had been making their delivery when they were approached by the three armed men , who threatened them and demanded they hand over a box of money . It is understood the cash taken was in the region of â£50,000 . Following the robbery , the three men got into a white seat leon car , which sped off along west nile street towards the cowcaddens area . The car has since been found in scott street , near stow college . Police said it was being taken for forensic examination . Inquiries have so far revealed that the car performed a u-turn on west nile street , causing a cyclist to take evasive action to avoid a collision , immediately prior to the robbery . Officers are appealing for the cyclist to contact them . The suspects are described as wearing dark-coloured clothing and balaclavas to conceal their identities . Det insp alasdair barlow said : `` we are reviewing cctv images in and around the city centre . `` we would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident or noticed the car , in particular the cyclist . `` as the car left the scene , it was being driven at speed so people may have noticed its excessive speed .

Piedt , 25 , playing just his second test , took four of the first five wickets to fall , including that of kohli whose fluent 70-run stand with rahane was ended in bizarre fashion . The india captain , who won the toss for a fourth time , smashed a full-blooded sweep into temba bavuma at short-leg and after the ball ballooned into the air , wicketkeeper dane vilas dived forward to take the catch . That sparked a mini collapse with three wickets falling for three runs before rahane , who hit two sixes and nine boundaries in his first half century at home , steadied the innings and took india beyond 200 . Rahane was helped by jadeja , whose 59-ball innings was ended by a smart dean elgar catch at midwicket off the bowling of abbott .

Edward alexander lee , 34 , was sentenced to three years on probation at belfast crown court on wednesday . Judge gordon kerr qc said it was the best way of protecting society and helping lee to change his ways . Lee , originally from whitehall square , belfast , but now living in england , pleaded guilty to a total of 15 charges related to child pornography . The court was told the vast majority of the images were in the lowest categories , although some were in the higher - more serious - categories . Lee was described by his wife as a being `` loving and normal young man '' . Judge kerr said that while he had viewed the images for his `` own strange pleasure '' , they were serious matters as `` children were abused for these images to be made '' . He added that children would continue to be abused while people like lee continued to view such material , and that `` society would not tolerate such behaviour '' . Judge kerr said a sentence of up to a year in prison would do very little to assist lee or the community . Placing him on probation , he ordered him to complete a course on sexual offending to help him stop viewing such images . Earlier , prosecutor simon jenkins said that when police went to lee 's then belfast home on 5 june , 2014 , he immediately confirmed he was the man they were looking for . On computer equipment seized , police uncovered a number of folders , which lee admitted creating .

The very large array ( vla ) traced the presence of ammonia in the gas giant to study the circulation systems below the visible cloud tops . For features such as the planet 's great red spot - a huge storm that has raged for at least 400 years - the scientists can see something of its roots . The observations go many tens of kilometres into the atmosphere . `` what really excites me is just the level of detail we see , '' said team-member michael wong from the university of california , berkeley . `` in our maps you can see different zones , turbulent features , vortices - even the great red spot . `` this has all been made possible by an upgrade to the vla and a new technique developed by one of our co-workers , '' he told bbc news . The karl g jansky very large array is based in the desert of new mexico , close to the town of socorro . As its name suggests , it is multi-antenna telescope . The upgrade dr wong is referring to has made the facility a far more sensitive tool for studying the radio emissions coming from objects in space . And the new technique he mentions counters the smearing effect you would ordinarily expect to get if you took a long exposure of a rapidly rotating body ( jupiter 's `` day '' lasts just 10 hours ) . The result is a wonderfully detailed impression of what is happening under the immediate surface of the many-banded weather systems that race across the top of planet 's atmosphere . The team looks at the glow of ammonia because it is a tracer for the dynamical flow in the planet 's gases , which are dominated by hydrogen and helium . At earth , you might do something similar by using water as the tracer . `` we see the actual glow of the ammonia itself , and the variation in depth is correlated with brightness , '' explained dr wong . `` the deepest we can see in this dataset is about 12 bar - 12 times the earth 's atmospheric pressure . '' Plumes of ammonia are observed to rise up in waves . The team writes in the journal science that the ammonia in these plumes will eventually condense out at higher altitudes , and could explain the ammonia ice clouds detected by the galileo spacecraft in the 1990s . `` all told , there is a wealth of information about the structure of jupiter 's atmosphere in these new vla images , '' said imke de pater , the lead author on the science paper . `` we hope to resolve a number of outstanding questions with these and future studies using similar techniques .

Although no formal peace deal has been signed , the apparent ceasefire is thought to be the first step towards a more lasting agreement . `` our truce is with god , with society and with the authorities , '' announced a spokesman for mara salvatrucha , identified only as marco . `` we ask society and the authorities to forgive us for the damage we have done , '' he said at a news conference inside a prison in the honduran city of san pedro sula . A leader of the rival 18 street gang - who did not want to be identified - offered the same promises , but only `` if the government will listen , '' he added . On monday , the honduran president porfirio lobo personally offered his support for the truce . `` we have to look for anything that 's an alternative to violence , '' he told the associated press news agency . `` on the part of the government , we are open to any process that can lower violence .

Speaking after briefing the security council on the peace process , staffan de mistura said a partial truce agreed in february was `` barely alive '' . Violence in syria has intensified in recent days , despite the ceasefire . At least 20 civilians were reportedly killed on wednesday in government strikes on a hospital and nearby residential building in eastern aleppo . The dead included children , a dentist and the only paediatrician left in rebel-held areas of the city , civil defence volunteers told afp news agency . The upsurge in fighting in syria 's largest city comes amid reports that government forces , backed by russian air power , are gearing up for a major offensive there . Russia 's continuing war . Has opportunity for peace been lost ? What is left of syria ? Assad 's growing confidence . The escalation has threatened to derail the un-brokered peace talks , which resumed last month . The western-backed opposition delegation , the high negotiations committee ( hnc ) , last week suspended its role to protest against alleged ceasefire violations by the government and a fall in humanitarian aid deliveries to besieged areas . Speaking on wednesday after a third round of talks in geneva , mr de mistura said the fragile `` cessation of hostilities '' `` could collapse any time '' . He said that over the past 48 hours an average of one syrian had been killed every 25 minutes and one wounded every 13 minutes . For the peace talks to succeed , mr de mistura said , hostilities would need to be reduced to the levels seen immediately following the february agreement . Calling on the us and russia to co-operate , mr de mistura said that the legacies of both president barack obama and president vladimir putin were linked to the success of the peace process in syria . There will be one or two more rounds of talks before july , mr de mistura said . He added : `` there are still major differences on the major issues , but there is movement on certain areas where there was not before . '' Mr de mistura also said that equal rights and equal representation in major institutions for women was essential to the transition to a new syria . The peace talks do not involve the al-qaeda-linked al-nusra front and the so-called islamic state , which have been fighting government forces and other rebels across syria . The uk-based syrian observatory for human rights monitoring group confirmed on wednesday that the air strikes on a hospital and nearby buildings in aleppo were carried out by `` regime airplanes '' . Separately , 11 people were killed in western aleppo earlier on wednesday , the syrian observatory said .

        "source": "Decriminalising tv licence fee evasion could close bbc channels , the corporation 's strategy director has warned . James purnell said it would increase non-payment and cost the bbc £200m . The sum is the equivalent of bbc four , cbbc and cbeebies , which would have to be taken off air , mr purnell said at an event to relaunch the iplayer service . Culture secretary maria miller said the move should be discussed during talks to renew the bbc 's charter before 2017 . Mr purnell , who previously held the post in the labour government , said `` it would be a huge risk to do it now '' . `` the choice would be : either we take those services off or the government would have to have a higher licence fee , '' he said in reference to bbc four - the arts and culture channel - and the bbc 's children 's stations . He argued decriminalisation would inevitably lead to greater non-payment of the tv licence , which would force an increase in the fee . It is currently £145.50 and has been frozen at that annual amount since 2010 . It is needed to watch or record live broadcasts on any device . In 2012 about 155,000 people were convicted and fined for not paying the licence fee , while there were some 180,000 prosecutions . Mr purnell added downgrading licence fee evasion to a civil offence would penalise the poor . `` either you have a low penalty - in which case the evasion rates would go up and everyone would have to pay a higher licence fee - or a penalty which is higher and more difficult to pay , '' he said . The bbc has previously said `` legislation is a matter for the government '' . `` just a 1 % increase in evasion would lead to the loss of around £35m , the equivalent of around 10 bbc local radio stations , '' it added . The government has floated the idea to ease pressure on the courts system . But it will not be discussed before charter renewal talks - which determine how the bbc is funded what it does and how it is managed . The current bbc charter runs out in 2016 . Meanwhile , labour mp john mcdonnell has tabled an early day motion in parliament calling on the bbc to reverse its decision to close bbc three as a television channel . The motion stated bbc three has been the home of programmes including gavin and stacey , and raised fears changes could lead to compulsory redundancies . It added the bbc should receive a licence fee increase that tracks inflation when the corporation 's charter is renewed next year .",

Longer term the firm said piloting of larger jets , such as cargo planes , could be controlled in this way without the need for a crew on board . However , one aviation expert told the bbc he thought the industry would be unlikely to adopt such technology due to a perception of being potentially unsafe . Drone specialist tekever , which works with security firms , police forces and the military , adapted existing electroencephalography ( eeg ) technology so it could issue instructions to the software used to give the unmanned drone instructions . Eeg works by detecting activity in specific parts of the brain . After several months of training , `` pilots '' are said to be able to teach their brain how to think about moving a small circle on a computer screen either up or down , which in turn steers the drone left or right . `` we believe people will be able to pilot aircraft just like they perform everyday activities like walking or running , '' said ricardo mendes , tekever 's chief operating officer . `` we truly believe that brainflight represents the beginning of a tremendous step change in the aviation field , empowering pilots and de-risking missions , and we 're looking forward to deliver these benefits to the market with highly innovative products .

Thai officials said the event , which was halted minutes before it was due to start , could have affected relations between the two countries .

Thai police said the event at the foreign correspondents club of thailand could `` have an impact on the country 's security or could affect the friendship and cooperation between thailand and vietnam '' . It is the third human rights event at the venue that has been halted by authorities in the past month .

The ex-pupils were caught up in a violent dispute outside holy cross primary school in 2001 , which made headlines around the world at the time . The department of justice confirmed the payments after a freedom of information request from the belfast telegraph . The doj has received eight claims so far , three of which have been settled . The payments were made under the terms of the northern ireland criminal injuries compensation scheme 2002 . However , the department would not disclose how much money has been paid out to the former holy cross pupils , in order to protect their identities . It told the newspaper this level of detail was `` exempt from disclosure '' under the freedom of information act and would `` contravene the first principle of the data protection act '' . The school was thrust into the international spotlight at the start of term in september 2001 , when hundreds of loyalist protesters tried to block the main route taken by the children and their parents on their walk to class . The three-month protest was sparked by a local dispute between catholic and protestant residents in ardoyne , north belfast . The protestants claimed that catholics were attacking their homes and said the school protest was their way of highlighting their concerns . However , stones , bottles , fireworks and even a blast bomb were used during weeks of unrest . Following the initial violence , the police and army put up crash barriers to keep a corridor route open for the holy cross pupils . Armed police officers escorted the children to class until the dispute was resolved . Ardoyne 's parish priest at the time , fr aidan troy , told the belfast telegraph he could `` fully understand why people who have been through trauma would want to apply for compensation '' . `` these were girls aged between four and 11 , they were very young and very impressionable and were deeply affected by it . Every one of us were , '' he said . The priest added that while he would not `` go down the route of compensation myself '' he could `` well imagine the impact would be very great on children at such a formative age '' . `` you could see their trauma , '' said fr troy . About 100 pupils needed counselling due to their daily ordeal , according to principal at the time , anne tanney . Speaking to the bbc in 2004 , she said that even as an adult , she was traumatised by the protests . `` there were times when i could n't eat , could n't sleep , '' she said . `` i used to bite my lip , trying not to cry in front of the children .

Benchmark brent crude hit $ 50.22 per barrel at one stage on thursday , its highest level since early november . The rise followed us data showing that oil inventories had fallen after supply disruptions due to fires in canada . Brent crude has now risen 80 % since it hit 13-year lows of below $ 28 a barrel at the start of the year . Us crude oil inventories fell by 4.2 million barrels to 537.1 million barrels in the week to may 20 , according to us department of energy data . Canada is the biggest supplier to the us and wildfires in the western provinces have reduced supplies by about a million barrels per day .

Short-term disruptions to oil supplies have also lifted the price , offsetting higher production from iran and saudi arabia . As well as the disruption to key oil production facilities in canada , attacks by militant groups continue to restrict oil pipelines in nigeria .

Thousands of border agency workers are expected to strike on 30 november in protest at government pension changes . Ministers fear there could be major disruption for travellers , so volunteers are being asked to step in . Pcs union chief mark serwotka said ministers were in a `` blind panic '' and should be resolving the dispute . The uk border agency has insisted the civil servants will be properly trained . It is expected they would mainly check the passports of travellers arriving from the european economic area and man so-called `` e-gates '' where passengers use their biometric passports . A ukba spokesman said : `` the security of the uk border remains our top priority and it is absolutely right we explore all options to ensure we minimise any disruption caused by planned union action . '' However , union chiefs expressed concern that the officials might not be properly trained and that borders could be put at risk . Mr serwotka , general secretary of the public and commercial services union , blamed ministers for leaving it so late to try and resolve the dispute . He told bbc radio 4 's today programme that the call to civil servants was an example of `` blind panic '' at the 11th hour , he said , and accused the government of engaging in a misleading `` pr exercise '' about public sector pensions to try to force through `` damaging '' changes . `` instead of scratching around trying to put untrained people on the front line , they should say today they want urgent talks to try to resolve the dispute , '' he said . The government has confirmed earlier reports that ukba is planning to fly some officials home from overseas positions to help deal with the strike . In the wake of the recent row between home secretary theresa may and former uk border force chief brodie clark over the relaxation of controls during the summer , it is extremely unlikely that officials would be prepared to bypass any rules to ease the pressure of queues . The bbc has also learned that the government has told union bosses that they are not prepared to offer any further concessions over pension reforms as a result of the planned strikes . The government recently made what it describes as an improved offer to the unions , promising that public sector workers ten years away from retirement would not see any change to their pensions . It also promised improved accrual rates . Ministers fear that any further concessions would send the wrong signal to financial markets by suggesting that the government was not serious about cutting the deficit and making substantial savings in the public sector pension bill . Ministers argue that public sector pensions have become unaffordable because of rising life expectancy , but they insist that even after the planned changes , state employees will still be better off than the majority of workers in the private sector . Unions say their members are being asked to work longer , contribute more and receive less .",

One of his first jobs will be to find a replacement for stuart gulliver , the chief executive of hsbc , who plans to step down next year .

        "source": "More new mothers are opting to try breastfeeding their babies , latest uk figures reveal . The nhs information centre data shows more than eight out of 10 newborns are now breastfed at least once after birth , up from six out of 10 in 1990 . Experts said the increase was welcome and partly due to public awareness that `` breast is best '' for mother and child . But the figures do not reveal how many mums stick at it for the recommended first six months of a baby 's life . Many women struggle to continue to exclusively breastfeed . And the royal college of midwives is concerned that some new mothers are not getting the support they need to encourage breastfeeding . Spokeswoman jane munro criticised the department of health in england for axing funding for national breastfeeding awareness week , which runs this week . `` we do not want to see the ground we have gained lost . '' She added : `` we know that many women stop breastfeeding when they leave hospital . `` this is why it is so important that they are able to get advice and support from their midwife , and that there are enough midwives with the time to offer these women the help they need . '' The government said it was committed to training up to an extra 4,200 health visitors by 2015 who would `` be able to help support women who want to breastfeed but may find it difficult '' . According to the latest figures , breastfeeding rates were higher in england than in scotland , northern ireland and wales , although rates have risen in most areas .

The nhs information centre data shows more than eight out of 10 newborns are now breastfed at least once after birth , up from six out of 10 in 1990 . Experts said the increase was welcome and partly due to public awareness that `` breast is best '' for mother and child . But the figures do not reveal how many mums stick at it for the recommended first six months of a baby 's life . Many women struggle to continue to exclusively breastfeed .

Armed officers working at parliament carry a primary weapon , a sidearm and a taser .

The police , local authorities and transport bosses will all discuss where to install extra measures to protect the public . The mayor of london 's office says it is currently considering where more barriers could be installed . Why not build a 6in [ 15cm ] concrete barrier on the bridge pavements to protect pedestrians from the traffic ? Nick beake : an independent review commissioned by the mayor of london , sadiq khan , last year recommended that more bollards be installed in busy parts of london to protect pedestrians from a nice- or berlin-style attack , where lorries were driven into crowds . The report author , lord harris of haringey , also called on the authorities to make more use of temporary barriers during big public events . What is the correct immediate response for members of the public caught up in this sort of attack ? Nick beake : the current terrorist threat is rated as `` severe '' , which means an attack is highly likely .

Greek officials had been expected to meet representatives of eu creditors in the greek capital athens on friday . But a european commission spokeswoman later said those representatives would arrive `` in the coming days '' . Separately , greece formally submitted a request for a new loan from the international monetary fund ( imf ) . In a letter to imf head christine lagarde dated 23 july but released to the public on friday , greek finance minister euclid tsakalotos wrote that athens was `` seeking a new loan '' . Greece had initially planned not to ask the imf for more funds , reports say . Greek mps have approved tough new conditions set by the eu lenders for talks on the bailout . It is unclear when imf officials will be joining the negotiations . The washington-based imf wants greece 's debt burden to be reduced to a level it considers `` sustainable '' , but it faces resistance from reluctant european partners . Eu officials said on friday that there were `` logistical issues to solve '' before high-level talks with athens could begin , but that negotiations were taking place at a technical level . The greek team had been expected to meet top representatives from the european commission , european central bank ( ecb ) and european stability mechanism ( esm ) - the eurozone 's main bailout fund . Talks on the bailout package are expected to last a month . Tight capital controls , introduced at the end of june , remain in place to prevent a run on greece 's cash-strapped banks . Pm tsipras faced a backlash from mps in his own left-wing syriza party , during two parliamentary votes on austerity measures required by the creditors in order for negotiations to start . But he secured parliament 's backing after a second crucial vote passed early on thursday . The reforms debated this week included changes to greek banking and an overhaul of the judiciary . Last week , greece passed an initial set of austerity measures , including tax rises and pushing back the retirement age . Mr tsipras has said that he is not happy with the measures imposed by creditors but that his government was forced to choose a `` difficult compromise '' to avoid greece exiting the eurozone . A decision on more contentious measures - phasing out early retirement and tax rises for farmers - has been pushed back to august . Demonstrations have taken place on the streets of athens against the bailout deal and trade unions have taken strike action . On wednesday , the ecb increased its cash lifeline to greek banks by €900m - the second rise in a week . The imf confirmed on monday that greece had cleared its overdue debt repayments of €2.05bn and was no longer in arrears . The repayments , which included €4.2bn to the ecb , were made possible by a short-term eu loan of €7.16bn . Greece 's next major deadline is 20 august , when it must pay €3.2bn owed to the ecb , followed by a payment of €1.5bn to the imf in september .",

Bruce adamson also called on ministers to gather accurate data on the number of children who go hungry because they do not have access to free meals during school holidays . About 255,230 pupils are registered for free school meals in scotland . The government said it was `` taking steps '' to measure food insecurity . Mr adamson paid tribute to charities such as the trussell trust , which has begun a pilot project in glasgow to offer cookery lessons to parents struggling to make ends meet during the holidays .

The cumbernauld-based firm , which also makes rubicon and tizer , said it would cut irn bru 's sugar content from about 10g per 100ml to just below 5g . It will reduce the calorie count per can from just under 140 to about 66 . Ag barr said the move was part of a `` long-standing sugar reduction programme '' . It confirmed in a stock market announcement on wednesday that more than 90 % of its portfolio would contain less than 5g of total sugar per 100ml by this autumn . Tizer is already below that threshold , while the rubicon carbonates range will all have less than 5g of sugar per 100ml by the middle of this year , the company said . The uk government plans to introduce a levy on sugary drinks in april 2018 . The soft drinks industry levy ( sdil ) will have two bands in the uk - one for soft drinks with more than 5g of sugar per 100ml and a higher one for drinks with more than 8g per 100ml . Ministers hope the move will help tackle the nation 's obesity problem . A spokesman for the company said : `` irn bru will still be made with sugar . We are not removing all the sugar , but we are reducing the amount . `` having worked on this for some time , we are carefully blending and balancing a mix of sugar , sweeteners and our original and best flavour essence to deliver the great taste of irn bru but with less sugar . `` we 're doing this because evidence shows that most consumers want to reduce their sugar intake while still enjoying great tasting drinks . `` 86 % of consumers are concerned about the amount of sugar in food and drink that they consume . `` that said , we have taken the soft drinks sugar tax thresholds into account when determining the levels of sugar reduction , but never compromising on taste . '' In the past year , the company has introduced two new drinks - irn bru xtra and rubicon spring - both of which contain no added sugar . Chief executive roger white said : `` evidence shows that consumers want to reduce their sugar intake while still enjoying great tasting drinks . `` we 've responded by significantly reducing sugar across our portfolio in recent years , through reformulation and innovation . `` today 's announcement builds on this progress and we are now expanding our successful sugar reduction plans to include our iconic irn bru brand .

He said he had put his trust in the people who were responsible for the party 's accounts and did not think he had to look over their shoulders . Mr cope was already expected to face challenges for the leadership of the party after the ump 's poor result in the european parliament elections . It came second to the far-right front national . Mr sarkozy , who lost the presidency to francois hollande in 2012 , is rumoured to be preparing to make a comeback in 2017 . He has not commented on the scandal over his 2012 campaign finances .",

The buglife conservation charity says the recent period of damp weather has seen the numbers of bees , wasps , moths and butterflies shrink in 2012 . Its chief executive matt shardlow said that if the country keeps on having periods of damp weather , then it could prove dangerous for some rare species . `` they might not recover and could be driven closer to extinction , '' he said . This year saw the wettest april-june quarter on record and further heavy rain in july . Mr shardlow said the damp conditions have resulted in fewer aphids for wasps to feed on , which has reduced their numbers . It is likely to take two more years for their numbers to recover , he added . He also said the approximately 250 species of bees in the uk need high temperatures to gather nectar and pollen . `` we are seeing very low numbers of them now , as well as small bumble bees , which is a sign they have n't had enough nectar and pollen to feed on . '' Buglife says there is no specific data collated on various insect numbers , but that its volunteers and experts have been spotting numbers and will detect `` massive year-on-year variation '' which they have reported this year . However , some data is collated on butterfly numbers , and mr shardlow says that this year could see the lowest number of that insect ever recorded in the uk . Moths , too , are being seen in fewer numbers , he said . However , the wet weather has been good news for some insects , such as the crane fly , drone fly and mosquitoes as well as molluscs such as slugs and snails , which all thrive in the damp conditions . `` this means that anything which feeds on slugs and snails will also benefit this year , '' mr shardlow said . `` we 've had reports of large numbers of glow worms , for example , which feed on slugs and snails . '' But richard ridler , chairman of essex beekeepers ' association , says this year 's bad weather has not necessarily killed off bees , just stopped them from venturing out into fields and gardens . `` the problem was that we had an appalling start to the year , which meant the bees stayed at home . Instead of going out , they stayed in their hives and ate their honey . I 've had 25 % of the honey yield that i would have expected this year . `` so the public saw a lot less of them .

He added that he `` would n't withdraw a word '' of what he had said and was thinking only of what what would happen after the election . `` the fact is , if we are going into [ stormont ] castle , it will be with a nationalist party , '' he said . `` now , would i rather go in with sinn fã©in or the sdlp ? I would rather go in with the sdlp . '' Mr nesbitt went on to say that , on monday , he spent a lot of time time knocking doors in heavily unionist areas with `` very little criticism and a lot of support for what i was talking about '' . `` i am confident in my position and i 'm very confident and relaxed that [ candidates ] behind me are taking different positions in terms of vote transfer , '' he said . `` but people will come back on 2 march to thinking about the â£85,000 a day that is going up in smoke , the 10 years of the dup and sin fã©in in that castle and the impossibility , no matter what anybody writes in a platform piece for the newspaper , of leopards changing their spots .

On the theme of the election being a referendum , he said it was about `` incompetence , arrogance , cronyism and the strong whiff of corruption '' .

In experiments on mice , the stem cells were genetically engineered to produce and secrete toxins which kill brain tumours , without killing normal cells or themselves . Researchers said the next stage was to test the procedure in humans . A stem cell expert said this was `` the future '' of cancer treatment . The study , published in the journal stem cells , was the work of scientists from massachusetts general hospital and the harvard stem cell institute . For many years , they had been researching a stem-cell-based therapy for cancer , which would kill only tumour cells and no others . They used genetic engineering to make stem cells that spewed out cancer-killing toxins , but , crucially , were also able to resist the effects of the poison they were producing . They also posed no risk to normal , healthy cells . In animal tests , the stem cells were surrounded in gel and placed at the site of the brain tumour after it had been removed . Their cancer cells then died as they had no defence against the toxins . Dr khalid shah , lead author and director of the molecular neurotherapy and imaging lab at massachusetts general hospital and harvard medical school , said the results were very positive . `` after doing all of the molecular analysis and imaging to track the inhibition of protein synthesis within brain tumours , we do see the toxins kill the cancer cells . '' He added : `` cancer-killing toxins have been used with great success in a variety of blood cancers , but they do n't work as well in solid tumours because the cancers are n't as accessible and the toxins have a short half-life . '' But genetically engineering stem cells has changed all that , he said . `` now , we have toxin-resistant stem cells that can make and release cancer-killing drugs . '' Chris mason , professor of regenerative medicine at university college london , said : `` this is a clever study , which signals the beginning of the next wave of therapies . `` it shows you can attack solid tumours by putting mini pharmacies inside the patient which deliver the toxic payload direct to the tumour . `` cells can do so much . This is the way the future is going to be . '' Nell barrie , senior science information manager for cancer research uk , said it was an `` ingenious approach '' . `` we urgently need better treatments for brain tumours and this could help direct treatment to exactly where it 's needed . `` but so far the technique has only been tested in mice and on cancer cells in the lab , so much more work will need to be done before we 'll know if it could help patients with brain tumours . '' She said this type of research could help boost survival rates and bring much-needed progress for brain cancers .

Kilcoo 's lead was cut to a point but the down champions moved three ahead again and then held on . Scotstown duo francis caulfield and sub brian mcginnity were sent off late on . Caulfield was dismissed after getting a second yellow card while mcginnity saw red after appearing to strike impressive kilcoo full-back darragh o'hanlon . The monaghan champions , beaten by crossmaglen after extra-time in last year 's provincial final , only had points from darren hughes and donal morgan to show for their early domination as several other good chances were missed .

Conor laverty 's typically busy display was crucial to kilcoo 's improvement as donal kane , paul devlin ( two ) and martin devlin also notched points .

Aidan branigan 's departure at half-time looked a blow for kilcoo but instead his replacement johnston went on to become the central personality in the match . The sides were level at 0-6 a piece when johnston held his nerve to produce a great finish past beggan after laverty had flicked on a long ball . After shane carey 's reply , johnston looked to have palmed in a second kilcoo goal but the effort was ruled out - harshly it appeared - for a square ball . The controversial decision looked as though it could be match-turning as another carey point cut kilcoo 's lead to the minimum but crucially beggan and carey then missed chances to get scotstown on terms . Paul devlin 's superb long-range point and an aaron morgan score , after more great work by laverty , left kilcoo three ahead with three minutes of normal time left and carey 's seventh point was all scotstown could summon in the remaining eight minutes of action .

        "source": "Iran 's stance towards the `` arrogant '' us will not change despite the nuclear deal reached earlier this week , supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei has said . In a speech marking the end of the islamic holy month of ramadan , he said iran still had sharp differences with the us , above all over the middle east . Iran would continue to back syria , iraq , the palestinians and `` oppressed people '' in yemen and bahrain , he said . The deal on iran 's nuclear programme came after years of negotiations . The agreement limits iran 's nuclear activities for at least 10 years in exchange for the gradual lifting of sanctions which have hampered the country 's economy . `` whether the [ nuclear ] deal is approved or disapproved , we will never stop supporting our friends in the region and the people of palestine , yemen , syria , iraq , bahrain and lebanon , '' ayatollah khamenei said . `` even after this deal our policy towards the arrogant us will not change . '' The supreme leader also denied that iran was intending to create a nuclear bomb . `` the americans say they stopped iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon , '' he said in his speech at the mosala mosque in tehran . `` they know it 's not true . We had a fatwa [ religious ruling ] declaring nuclear weapons to be religiously forbidden under islamic law . It had nothing to do with the nuclear talks . `` we have repeatedly said we do n't negotiate with the us on regional or international affairs ; not even on bilateral issues . `` there are some exceptions like the nuclear programme that we negotiated with americans to serve our interests ... Us policies in the region are diametrically opposed with iran 's policies .

        "reference": "Iran 's stance towards the `` arrogant '' us will not change despite the nuclear deal reached earlier this week , supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei has said . In a speech marking the end of the islamic holy month of ramadan , he said iran still had sharp differences with the us , above all over the middle east . Iran would continue to back syria , iraq , the palestinians and `` oppressed people '' in yemen and bahrain , he said . The deal on iran 's nuclear programme came after years of negotiations . The agreement limits iran 's nuclear activities for at least 10 years in exchange for the gradual lifting of sanctions which have hampered the country 's economy . `` whether the [ nuclear ] deal is approved or disapproved , we will never stop supporting our friends in the region and the people of palestine , yemen , syria , iraq , bahrain and lebanon , '' ayatollah khamenei said . `` even after this deal our policy towards the arrogant us will not change . '' The supreme leader also denied that iran was intending to create a nuclear bomb . `` the americans say they stopped iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon , '' he said in his speech at the mosala mosque in tehran . `` they know it 's not true . We had a fatwa [ religious ruling ] declaring nuclear weapons to be religiously forbidden under islamic law . It had nothing to do with the nuclear talks . `` we have repeatedly said we do n't negotiate with the us on regional or international affairs ; not even on bilateral issues . `` there are some exceptions like the nuclear programme that we negotiated with americans to serve our interests ... Us policies in the region are diametrically opposed with iran 's policies .

        "source": "British researchers have developed a test to detect alzheimer 's disease in its earliest stages . It works by looking for a combination of `` markers '' in the blood which are different in healthy people and those with the disease . Delegates at the alzheimer 's research uk conference heard that the university of nottingham is now developing a quick and easy test to do in clinics . It could mean much earlier diagnosis and better treatments , they said . The test uses some proteins that have been strongly linked with alzheimer 's disease , such as amyloid and apoe . But through careful analysis of blood from people with the disease , as well as those with early-stage memory problems , the researchers detected some other markers that were suggestive of the disease . Most notably , some proteins related to inflammation seem to have been added to increase the power of the test . Prof kevin morgan from the university of nottingham said they still had to validate the test and it could be a decade before it was used in patients . But he added that the combination of markers they had found was looking very promising . `` our findings are exciting because they show that it is technically possible to distinguish between healthy people and those with alzheimer 's using a blood test . `` as blood tests are a fast and easy way of aiding diagnosis , we are really encouraged by these findings and the potential they hold for the future . '' He said there were several ways the test could benefit patients , including giving people a definitive diagnosis , which was not always possible at the moment . It could also direct future therapies to make sure patients were getting the most appropriate treatment , he explained . Potentially , it could be a `` cheap and easy pre-screen '' test which enabled alzheimer 's to be picked up before symptoms appeared , he said . `` the way we see it working is you can test people and it will tell them if they have the all-clear , or if they are medium- or high-risk . `` if they are medium-risk , they can be monitored closely and high-risk patients can be referred to a specialist for more in-depth testing . '' Dr eric karran , director of research at alzheimer 's research uk , said : `` giving people with dementia an accurate diagnosis is not always easy , and so building up our armoury of diagnostic techniques is vital . `` while there is still some way to go before a test like this could become available , the results are promising . `` when used alongside other diagnostic techniques , a blood test like this could be a real help .

Flower , 26 , punched hohaia to the ground two minutes into saturday 's grand final , then landed a second blow to his face while he lay on the ground . Wales prop flower was sent off as the warriors were beaten 14-6 . The ban until 14 april takes in 10 super league games and the world club series match against brisbane broncos . New zealander hohaia had already accepted a one-game suspension for a forearm strike which came before flower 's punches . Flower was charged with a grade f offence - the most serious in the sport 's disciplinary rules - of `` violent and aggressive punching '' and `` punching an off-guard opponent '' , a charge which carries a minimum of an eight-game ban . Wigan rugby general manager kris radlinski , who accompanied flower to the hearing at the rugby football league in leeds , said in a statement : `` wigan warriors would like to go on record in saying that the rfl disciplinary committee handled a very difficult situation with professionalism and integrity . `` we fully support their assessment of saturday night 's incident involving our player , ben flower .

However , the country has seen an average of just under 6 % growth over the past decade and analysts have said growth is unlikely to improve for some time . `` the fourth quarter data is a positive surprise , '' economist tony nash told the bbc . `` but unfortunately the uptick will likely be short lived . We expect deterioration in the first quarter and it 'll be tough to regain growth momentum before 2017 , '' he added . Mr widodo made his promise to raise growth when his five-year term began in 2014 , but he has faced problems boosting government spending and has seen several large infrastructure projects delayed . A $ 5.5bn high-speed railway project , funded by china , was signed last year and is scheduled to be up and running by 2019 . But the project has faced widespread objections from transport experts and its long-term viability has been questioned . Mr widodo has also faced international condemnation for the country 's man-made forest fires , which have caused serious economic and environmental damage . In december , the world bank said indonesia 's forest fires last year had likely cost the country more than twice the amount spent on reconstruction efforts after the 2004 aceh tsunami . In its quarterly report , the bank said the fires had cost some 221tn indonesian rupiah ( $ 15.72bn ; â£10.5bn ) . It added that regional and global costs would be much higher .",

A government statement said the strike violated pakistan 's sovereignty . `` pakistan has repeatedly emphasised the importance of bringing an immediate end to drone strikes , '' a foreign ministry spokesman said . `` they are counter-productive , entail loss of innocent civilian lives and have human rights and humanitarian implications . '' In a separate development , at least six security personnel are reported to have been killed and at least six more injured in an early morning attack by militants at a checkpoint near peshawar . At least two more are reported to be missing , possibly kidnapped by the attackers . Reports citing local officials said most of those killed in the drone strike were thought to be from the militant haqqani group . Officials say four missiles were fired by a us drone , targeting two houses and two vehicles , near miranshah , the main town in north waziristan . A number of other people were also injured . The haqqani network has been described by us military commanders as one of the most resilient militant groups operating in afghanistan .

A morrisons spokesman said : `` sometimes we have to increase prices as a result of costs rising . '' Unilever has raised the wholesale price of many household products , including pg tips tea and pot noodles , because falls in the value of sterling have increased the cost of products made outside the uk . The pound has lost nearly a fifth of its value since the uk voted to leave the eu in a referendum in june . It is the world 's worst-performing currency on the global money markets this year . This makes imported goods more expensive because they continue to cost the same in dollars or euros , but the price is higher when converted into sterling . Morrisons said it did its best to avoid putting prices up . It added : `` more often than not we have been reducing prices and more than 3,000 products are currently cheaper in our supermarkets than they were last year . '' Tesco 's row with unilever broke out earlier this month and has since been resolved , according to both sides . However , the grocer reported that both tesco and asda have raised prices on a number of unilever products , and morrisons has also increased the prices of other items made by the company .

        "source": "The us senate has failed to pass a republican proposal to repeal president barack obama 's signature healthcare policy without replacing it . The 45-55 vote marks the second defeat for republicans aiming to pass a bill this week to undo the health policy . The vote came a day after the senate rejected a plan to repeal and replace the health law with a republican plan . Senators will now consider a `` skinny '' repeal , which would scale back some of the more controversial provisions . The `` skinny '' plan would eliminate unpopular parts of obamacare - the affordable care act - including the individual mandate requiring all americans to have health insurance coverage as well as a tax on medical devices . If that measure passes , the senate and house of representatives would then be tasked with finalising a bill that could still change during negotiations . If successful , the full house and senate would again have to approve the measure . Seven republicans opposed the repeal-only plan on wednesday , which included a two-year delay on a replacement in the hope of finding agreement before that time elapses . The defeat is the latest blow for president donald trump , who put repealing obamacare at the centre of his election campaign , and underscores sharp divisions within the republican party over a replacement plan . A proposal to repeal and replace obamacare with the better care reconciliation act ( bcra ) , a republican plan that was crafted over last two months , collapsed on tuesday night after nine republicans voted against it . Republicans have long railed against obamacare as government overreach , criticising the system for introducing government-run marketplaces , where premiums have risen sharply for some people . The party 's proposed alternative included steep cuts to medicaid , a healthcare programme for the poor and disabled . And it removes obamacare 's individual mandate requiring all americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty . About 20 million people gained health insurance under former president obama 's affordable care act . The non-partisan congressional budgetary office ( cbo ) found the bill would strip 22 million americans of health insurance over the next decade . Other attempts to replace obamacare have failed in recent weeks due to republican divisions . In an early morning tweet on wednesday , mr trump lambasted republican senator lisa murkowski of alaska for opposing the party 's plan , saying she `` really let the republicans , and our country , down yesterday . Too bad ! '' Mrs murkowski was one of two republicans earlier on tuesday to vote against allowing the debate on healthcare legislation reform to go forward . But her party eked out a victory after vice president mike pence cast the tie-breaking vote which allowed discussion to take place . Senator john mccain , who was recently diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour , received a standing ovation as he returned to congress to cast his `` yes '' vote . President trump tweeted his thanks to the arizona senator for playing `` such a vital role '' in the vote .",

Seven republicans opposed the repeal-only plan on wednesday , which included a two-year delay on a replacement in the hope of finding agreement before that time elapses . The defeat is the latest blow for president donald trump , who put repealing obamacare at the centre of his election campaign , and underscores sharp divisions within the republican party over a replacement plan . A proposal to repeal and replace obamacare with the better care reconciliation act ( bcra ) , a republican plan that was crafted over last two months , collapsed on tuesday night after nine republicans voted against it . Republicans have long railed against obamacare as government overreach , criticising the system for introducing government-run marketplaces , where premiums have risen sharply for some people . The party 's proposed alternative included steep cuts to medicaid , a healthcare programme for the poor and disabled . And it removes obamacare 's individual mandate requiring all americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty . About 20 million people gained health insurance under former president obama 's affordable care act . The non-partisan congressional budgetary office ( cbo ) found the bill would strip 22 million americans of health insurance over the next decade . Other attempts to replace obamacare have failed in recent weeks due to republican divisions . In an early morning tweet on wednesday , mr trump lambasted republican senator lisa murkowski of alaska for opposing the party 's plan , saying she `` really let the republicans , and our country , down yesterday . Too bad ! '' Mrs murkowski was one of two republicans earlier on tuesday to vote against allowing the debate on healthcare legislation reform to go forward . But her party eked out a victory after vice president mike pence cast the tie-breaking vote which allowed discussion to take place . Senator john mccain , who was recently diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour , received a standing ovation as he returned to congress to cast his `` yes '' vote . President trump tweeted his thanks to the arizona senator for playing `` such a vital role '' in the vote .",

        "source": "More than a million people have signed a petition calling for the judge in the controversial stanford university sexual assault case to be sacked . Judge aaron persky has been heavily criticised for giving student brock turner six months for assaulting an unconscious woman last year . Two other petitions have reached 115,000 and 175,000 signatures each . The petitions have no legal force but organisers hope they will increase pressure on politicians to act . Mr persky , a superior court judge in santa clara county , california , has reportedly received death threats in the wake of the case . The jail sentence he handed down to turner has been widely criticised as too lenient . Prosecutors had called for six years . Turner was seen by two other students sexually assaulting his victim , now 23 , behind an outdoor rubbish bin . He tried to flee the scene but was caught and later admitted to the assault in court . Rights activists and members of the general public have accused mr persky of being influenced by turner 's upbringing in a wealthy , white family , and his achievements as a college swimmer . The petition , posted on change.org , says that mr persky had `` failed to send the message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class , race , gender or other factors '' . The judge said in his remarks that he was concerned about the `` severe impact '' a longer sentence would have on turner 's life . Turner 's father was also criticised after issuing a statement to the court saying his son was paying a steep price for only `` 20 minutes of action '' . Turner , who was a promising swimmer expected to compete for the us at olympic level , has been banned for life by usa swimming , the governing body for professional swimming in the us . The victim , who has not been named by the press , read an impact statement in court which was later read by millions . Us vice-president joe biden , who is involved in a campaign against campus assaults , wrote her an open letter praising her for her courage and saying he was `` filled with furious anger '' at the course of events . The cast of the tv show girls have also made a video backing the woman and other victims of sexual assault .",

We 're not sure which would smell worse , this butter , or ... last year , divers were exploring a shipwreck buried deep under the sea near sweden when they found this jar . They did n't know there was cheese inside until the journey to the surface caused some of the contents to leak , releasing a very strong smell . The stinky discovery was made when the team were investigating the wreck of the kronan , a warship that sank 340 years ago . Now that 's taking mature cheddar to the extreme ! In 2015 , an american couple revealed they were still eating their wedding cake , 60 years after it was first baked in 1955 . Ann and ken fredericks , from florida , decided to eat one piece of the fruit cake every year to celebrate the day they got married . They said their children were horrified at them eating such old food but insist that it still tastes as good as ever ! We 're wondering how long it 'll take them to finish the whole cake ...",

The group , which included student leader joshua wong , had staged a protest at an iconic sculpture symbolising the handover . The golden sculpture of a bauhinia flower - hong kong 's emblem - by the city 's harbour was a gift from china . Mr xi arrived for the three-day visit with his wife peng liyuan at the city 's main chek lap kok airport . The couple were welcomed by a marching band and children waving flags .

The review into 22 abuse cases in northern ireland criticised the authorities for not doing enough . The young people went missing a number of times over a 20-month period while being looked after in the care system . The police service of northern ireland ( psni ) said it has recently made policy changes aimed at keeping children safe . In september 2013 , the psni said it had begun a major investigation into the sexual exploitation of children and young people who had gone missing from care in northern ireland . Officers said they had identified 22 people , aged between 13 and 18 , who may have been sexually exploited . The psni investigation was known was operation owl . Thursday 's report , examining the psni response , has been published by the safeguarding board for northern ireland . It said psni officers were effective in locating the teenagers and returning them to the care system . However , it found that they failed to properly examine the extent of the child sexual exploitation taking place and their attempts to find and stop the abusers was - in the words of the review - `` limited and inconsistent '' . While there is praise for the help offered by some staff from residential care homes , stormont 's health minister simon hamilton said that the report shows not enough support was given to protect the teenagers from harm or the risk of harm . He said the review had identified `` a significant gap '' in knowledge about perpetrators of child sexual exploitation . The head of the psni 's public protection branch , det ch supt george clarke said that following operation owl , the psni has `` implemented a number of changes in our approach to handling this issue to ensure we are doing everything we can to keep children and young people safe '' . `` indeed , in april of this year , the psni formed the public protection branch which is now responsible for policy and practice in relation to a number of areas including child sexual exploitation . `` the new structures enable us to work closely with our partner agencies in a much more cohesive way than before to ensure better protection and safeguarding for children and young people . '' The office said the psni has also revised its missing persons protocol , a joint policy with the health and social care authorities . `` this protocol is designed to support effective collaborative safeguarding responses by the psni and social services in respect of children who run away or go missing from their homes or care placements and builds upon developments in our knowledge and experience , '' mr clarke added .

Arriva trains wales , whose wales and borders franchise expires in 2018 , is adding morning weekday services into cardiff central from barry and radyr . Economy minister ken skates had said arriva 's profits were `` too high . '' The wales and borders franchise - which is one of the uk 's most heavily subsidised , receiving between â£110m-â£160m a year - has seen passenger numbers rise from 18 million in 2003 to 30 million . About 265,000 people use cardiff central station weekly and a bbc investigation found overcrowding in cardiff stations during the morning commute was rising at a faster rate than anywhere else outside london , according to figures from the department for transport . Arriva trains wales now plans to add extra capacity and extra trains from 22 may on the following routes . Arriva trains wales said the additional trains were `` subject to railway approval processes '' but the announcement is `` one of the most significant improvements to valleys commuters in a decade '' . It said to implement the changes , the operator `` needed to remove one midday penarth service and one midday barry service '' . The firm has a zero growth contract - which means it has the same number of trains it had when it began operations in 2003 . It said the additions `` would not have been possible '' without network rail 's recent â£300m signalling upgrade works and new platform eight at cardiff central . `` this is one of the most significant improvements to valleys commuters in a decade , since the opening of the ebbw vale line , '' said arriva trains wales customer services director , lynne milligan . `` with only a limited number of trains in our fleet and the lack of availability in the uk we have had to work hard to get the most from what we 've got .

Kris doolan 's consolation gave home fans something to clap but jordan roberts notched a fourth for caley . It was an unusually abject performance from the glasgow jags , who were booed several times by their own fans and now sit six points ahead of the relegation zone with three games left . Media playback is not supported on this device . The match doubled as a bit of window shopping for caley thistle boss john hughes , who has eyes for a few out-of-contract partick players .

Inverness broke on the counter attack with just under a quarter-of-an-hour gone and a fine pass by andrea mbuyi-mutombo released tremarco .

Speaking during a parliamentary debate , philip hollobone said individual fireworks are extremely dangerous . But business minister jo johnson dismissed a ban and insisted current laws work well . The debate came after a petition to restrict the use of fireworks attracted more than 100,000 names . The petition , which called for restrictions on when fireworks can be used , was started by jill cutsforth , from beverley , east yorkshire , and julie doorne , from sleaford , lincolnshire in a bid to reduce stress and fear in people and animals . But , mr hollobone , mp for kettering , called for the government to go further .

'' Instead , she called for tighter regulations to govern how people use fireworks .

He added : `` restrictions in use could lead to a drop in legitimate sales , leading to job losses not only in the firework industry but independent and associated businesses .

Mr johnson acknowledged the concerns raised but said restricting their use to traditional holidays would be ineffective . `` it is likely that those who already use fireworks in an anti-social or inconsiderate way would not be deterred by further regulation , '' he said . He added : `` restrictions in use could lead to a drop in legitimate sales , leading to job losses not only in the firework industry but independent and associated businesses . '' Bracknell mp phillip lee also warned the debate that restricting the number of days that displays are permitted could reduce the viability of well-performing fireworks businesses . The government said following the debate it would continue to monitor the situation closely .",

It looks certain whittingham will commit his future to the bluebirds by signing a new contract . `` we 'll talk about that before the fa cup probably , '' said warnock .

Whittingham also finished joint-top scorer in the championship in the 2009-10 campaign having found the net 20 times in the league for the bluebirds . During his time with cardiff , whittingham has turned down the chance of a move away from the welsh club .

Forwards laura keates and amy cokayne extended the visitors ' lead before backs emily scarratt and lydia thompson rounded off the win with fine tries . With the under-20 men 's side having won a grand slam earlier on friday , england 's men will look to complete a hat-trick by beating ireland in dublin on saturday . The women , who return to ireland in the summer to defend their world title , have won their first six nations title since 2012 . Wing wilson hardy completed a fine england move in the 16th minute , but then ireland dominated play . Centre sene naoupu came within a metre of going over but was stopped by a superb tackle from flanker marlie packer , and home captain paula fitzpatrick was prevented from touching down by a posse of england players . England regrouped after half-time and extended their lead when replacement prop keates drove over the line from two metres out . Ireland were reduced to 14 players two minutes before the hour when substitute mairead coyne made a deliberate knock-on . Hooker cokayne burst through to increase england 's advantage but ireland hooker leah lyons responded to give ireland hope . However , scarratt finished off an excellent england move to put the result beyond doubt and then replacement winger thompson showed her pace to score england 's fifth try .

        "reference": "England completed a women 's six nations grand slam by beating a physical ireland 34-7 at rainy donnybrook . Media playback is not supported on this device . Amy wilson hardy went over in the corner as england scored from their only chance in the first half . Ireland could not breach england 's solid defence and were made to pay as the world champions ran in four tries . Forwards laura keates and amy cokayne extended the visitors ' lead before backs emily scarratt and lydia thompson rounded off the win with fine tries . With the under-20 men 's side having won a grand slam earlier on friday , england 's men will look to complete a hat-trick by beating ireland in dublin on saturday . The women , who return to ireland in the summer to defend their world title , have won their first six nations title since 2012 . Wing wilson hardy completed a fine england move in the 16th minute , but then ireland dominated play . Centre sene naoupu came within a metre of going over but was stopped by a superb tackle from flanker marlie packer , and home captain paula fitzpatrick was prevented from touching down by a posse of england players . England regrouped after half-time and extended their lead when replacement prop keates drove over the line from two metres out . Ireland were reduced to 14 players two minutes before the hour when substitute mairead coyne made a deliberate knock-on . Hooker cokayne burst through to increase england 's advantage but ireland hooker leah lyons responded to give ireland hope . However , scarratt finished off an excellent england move to put the result beyond doubt and then replacement winger thompson showed her pace to score england 's fifth try . Ireland : flood , tyrrell , murphy , naoupu , miller , stapleton , muldoon ; peat , lyons , egan , spence , reilly , griffin , molloy , fitzpatrick ( capt ) .

        "source": "A judge in brazil has revoked a decision which had halted work on the belo monte dam in the amazon region . Judge carlos castro martins reversed the order he had issued in september , which had barred any work on the belo monte dam that interfered with the natural flow of the xingu river . He said the company behind the project had subsequently shown its work would not harm local fishing . The project has been heavily criticised by environmentalists . Judge martins had originally ruled in favour of a fisheries group which argued that the dam would affect local fish stocks and could harm indigenous families who make a living from fishing . He had barred the norte energia company behind the project from all work which could interfere with the natural flow of the xingu river , including building a port , using explosives , installing dikes and building canals . Legal wrangling . Norte energia appealed against the decision and judge martins ruled on friday that construction work on the dam could go ahead as the company had shown that local fishing boats would not be blocked or hindered in their work . `` since the course of the water wo n't be altered , and there wo n't be much variation in the speed of its flow , ( the project ) wo n't have a major influence on the habitat of ornamental fish species used for fishing , '' he said . Judge martins did , however , say that the wider environmental impact of the project `` could only be felt and analysed once the work was completed , as the studies into its effects were only forecasts of what could happen '' . He also said that any work would have to comply with the regulations laid down by brazil 's indian affairs department ( funai ) and the national environment agency , ibama . Norte energia said the temporary halt on the building work had not affected the project , as it had not yet reached the stage where the company needed to do any of the specific type of work which had fallen under the ban . If it goes ahead , the 11,000-megawatt dam will be the third biggest in the world - after the three gorges in china and itaipu , which is jointly run by brazil and paraguay . The government says it is crucial to meeting growing energy needs , but environmentalists and those fighting for indigenous rights have been vociferous in their opposition .",

Wales are yet to beat new zealand on their own turf and the all blacks have won their last 34 games at the auckland ground . The match will be new zealand 's first since beating australia 34-17 in the 2015 world cup final .

The next public consultation in the greater manchester spatial framework ( gmsf ) scheme was due in september but may not be published until summer 2018 . Regional mayor andy burnham promised to revise the plans following protests from affected communities . The revised plans will be announced `` in due course '' , the mayor 's office said . The gmsf scheme identifies sites for housing developments that may be built over the next 20 years . The area 's combined authority , which brings together 10 councils , published a joint plan last october to allocate land for development . Due to the scale of development required to meet expected population growth , it outlined plans to make swathes of protected greenbelt land available for new homes . The authority received more than 25,000 responses to the consultation while community groups protested against the plans . Mr burnham , who was elected as metropolitan mayor in may , promised to `` radically re-write '' the plans , calling them `` unfair and disproportionate '' . The bbc understands council leaders are not expecting the next consultation to take place until next year due to the work involved . Matthew collinge from the save our slattocks group , which is opposed to homes being built on greenbelt land between middleton and royton , said the delay was `` disappointing '' .

They need to know where those developments are going to happen . `` without a plan it 's going to be a lot more piecemeal because investors will have to take chances on where they can get development and the councils may not be in control of that .

        "source": "Thousands of jordanians have attended a protest demanding political reforms in amman , hours after king abdullah called early parliamentary elections . The muslim brotherhood 's political wing , the islamic action front , called for broader political representation and a more democratic parliament . People at the protest chanted : `` the people want to reform the regime . '' On thursday evening , the king dissolved parliament and called early elections , though he did not specify a date . He has said he wants polls to be held by the end of the year . The iaf said it expected 50,000 people to take part in the protest outside the capital 's al-husseini mosque after friday prayers . But the bbc 's wyre davies put the turnout at 10,000 people , which he said was the biggest protest seen in jordan for several years . Video footage showed protesters chanting slogans and waving flags . The afp news agency quoted people as shouting : `` we demand constitutional reform before the people revolt . The people want to reform the regime . '' A counter-rally , in support of king abdullah , which organisers had predicted would attract 200,000 supporters , was cancelled late on thursday in order to prevent clashes between the two groups . Earlier , police said they had detained eight people travelling towards the rally and had seized three vehicles containing sticks , knives and guns . Friday 's protest in the capital and the dissolution of parliament come amid mounting opposition anger at the electoral law passed in july by the government of the conservative prime minister fayez al-tarawneh . The electoral law increased the number of seats in the house of representatives from 120 to 150 seats and gave the electorate two votes - one for a district representative and one for national level lists that include political parties - replacing the single non-transferable vote . The iaf 's leader , hamza mansour , dismissed the legislation as `` just a cosmetic change meant to buy time and insufficient for real reforms '' . Opposition parties demanded that 50 % of seats be allocated to party lists , but the new electoral law gave them just 27 seats , or 18 % . They also complained that the new law would strengthen supporters of the king by allocating three more seats for women from bedouin districts . This , they argued , would continue to marginalise jordanians of palestinian origin - who make up 60 % of the population but have little political power - in favour of those descended from jordan 's original bedouin inhabitants - whose tribes dominate the government and security forces and are the bedrock of the hashemite monarchy . Traditionally , many of the iaf 's supporters have been jordanians of palestinian origin . The opposition also demanded that parliament , rather than the king , should have the right to appoint and dismiss the prime minister . Despite the call for reforms , jordan has so far avoided the unrest and political upheaval that rocked much of the arab world last year . Protests have been relatively small and have not gained the same level of political momentum as those in tunisia , egypt , libya , yemen and syria . Correction 25 january 2013 : a previous version of this story incorrectly stated that members of the jordanian security forces were allowed to vote for the first time .",

He ordered roberts-jones to pay â£2,500 costs and sign on the sex offenders register .

He was a physics teacher at the â£31,000 a year school but now lives in france . The court heard details of the conviction are to be supplied to the french authorities to ensure roberts-jones , previously of preston street , exeter , is not able to work with children again . In may 2014 , he offered to give his victim a massage after she suffered cramp but went on to lift her top and try to pull down her trousers . Recorder mr philip mott , qc said there was a `` higher culpability because of the abuse of trust '' . He said : `` this was not just flirting and an error of judgment but a more determined effort to pursue your desire and overcome her resistance . '' The judge said roberts-jones , who now teaches adults in france , had experienced `` substantial punishment in terms of career , self image and place in society '' and suspended his sentence for two years . He ordered roberts-jones to pay â£2,500 costs and sign on the sex offenders register . Emily cook , for the defence , said there was an `` element of infatuation '' with the victim which `` got out of hand '' .",

The claim comes after extra fundraising powers for councils were outlined in last week 's government spending review . But the lga said councils would still face a combined shortfall of £6.8bn by the end of the parliament . The government said council tax was expected to be lower in real terms in 2020 than a decade earlier . In the spending review , chancellor george osborne said local authorities responsible for adult social care would be allowed to increase council tax by 2 % above existing limits . By adding in the maximum new levies allowable without a referendum , the lga estimated that band d bills could cost an average of just under £200 more over the next five years . It said this would not be enough , particularly as budgets continued to face new pressures such as those caused by an aging population . Any shortfall might have to be made up by further increases to costs such as car parking charges , it added . One senior councillor said councils were now also facing `` a reckless gamble '' of having to use cash reserves to fund services . A department for communities and local government spokesman said : `` in reality councils will have almost £200bn to spend on local services over the lifetime of this parliament , a cash terms increase and a reduction of just 1.7 % in real terms each year . `` the spending review offers a £3.5bn package for adult social care to ensure councils can support their older and most vulnerable residents , while at the same time council tax is expected to be less in 2019-20 in real terms than it was in 2010-11 . `` with councils accounting for a quarter of all public spending it 's right they continue to play their part in paying off the deficit .

        "source": "Free-runners gathered to remember a parkour enthusiast who died in an accident on the paris metro . Nye frankie newman , 17 , from aldershot in hampshire , died in the french capital on new year 's day . Speaking at the memorial in guildford , his mother debs malone told the crowd of teenagers to carry his spirit `` forever '' . A minute 's silence was held at the event , organised by the brewman parkour group mr newman co-founded . His friends took part in a `` remembrance jam '' afterwards . Ms malone , 49 , said : `` can i ask you all , please carry nye 's spirit with you forever and always , and smile . `` i want you all to put your hand on your heart now and we are going to get down for my boy . `` stay safe , stay brave , stay strong yeah ? And be happy . '' Alex grubb , 18 , who helped to organise the event , described the teenager as kind , caring and `` very eccentric '' . He said : `` he had his own style , he was n't like anyone else . He was a bit out there , very opinionated but very loving at the same time . '' Organisers estimated about 200 people attended the memorial . Before the event , guildford council and surrey police had warned businesses to take `` reasonable measures to prevent rooftop access '' . But organiser luke stones , 16 , said : `` we have had made it clear people should not go on rooftops . `` if they go on rooftops , it 's not parkour , that 's another sport . Today , we are sticking to ground level . '' He said rooftop running was more usually referred to as urbex , climbing or roof-topping . Mr stones said people had travelled from across europe and hong kong , where mr newman visited in the summer . He said organisers could not comment on mr newman 's death , but confirmed he `` was not participating in parkour '' at the time of the accident . Guildford council said it provided portsmouth road car park as a meeting place for the memorial , but not as a place for free-running .

        "reference": "Free-runners gathered to remember a parkour enthusiast who died in an accident on the paris metro . Nye frankie newman , 17 , from aldershot in hampshire , died in the french capital on new year 's day . Speaking at the memorial in guildford , his mother debs malone told the crowd of teenagers to carry his spirit `` forever '' . A minute 's silence was held at the event , organised by the brewman parkour group mr newman co-founded . His friends took part in a `` remembrance jam '' afterwards . Ms malone , 49 , said : `` can i ask you all , please carry nye 's spirit with you forever and always , and smile . `` i want you all to put your hand on your heart now and we are going to get down for my boy . `` stay safe , stay brave , stay strong yeah ? And be happy . '' Alex grubb , 18 , who helped to organise the event , described the teenager as kind , caring and `` very eccentric '' . He said : `` he had his own style , he was n't like anyone else . He was a bit out there , very opinionated but very loving at the same time . '' Organisers estimated about 200 people attended the memorial . Before the event , guildford council and surrey police had warned businesses to take `` reasonable measures to prevent rooftop access '' . But organiser luke stones , 16 , said : `` we have had made it clear people should not go on rooftops . `` if they go on rooftops , it 's not parkour , that 's another sport . Today , we are sticking to ground level . '' He said rooftop running was more usually referred to as urbex , climbing or roof-topping . Mr stones said people had travelled from across europe and hong kong , where mr newman visited in the summer . He said organisers could not comment on mr newman 's death , but confirmed he `` was not participating in parkour '' at the time of the accident . Guildford council said it provided portsmouth road car park as a meeting place for the memorial , but not as a place for free-running .

        "source": "A new record for a blue period picasso has been set at auction in new york . La gommeuse achieved the top price of $ 67.5m ( £45m ) at sotheby 's , as part of their impressionist & modern art sale on thursday . And van gogh 's atmospheric landscape , paysage sous un ciel mouvemente , sold for $ 54m ( £36m ) , helping to take the evening 's total to $ 306.7m ( £203m ) . Simon shaw , co-head of impressionist and modern art worldwide , called it `` a small sale that packed a real punch '' . He added : `` each season picasso has the remarkable ability to surprise , and tonight was no exception , with the unusual appearance of two blue period works , which set new benchmarks - both in oil and on paper . '' La gommeuse , described as most the important blue period picasso to come to the market in a generation , was painted in 1901 . The portrait is of a nude unnamed woman . Gommeuse , which translates into english as'gummy ' was a sexually charged slang word of the time for cafe-concert singers and their songs . It features a second portrait on the reverse of the canvas , which was hidden for a century until its discovery in 2000 during conservation work . The caricature of picasso 's friend pere manach was apparently intended as a gift for the catalan anarchist who shared the artist 's studio flat in the boulevard de clichy in paris . The painting was one of 47 works on offer , with just over three-quarters finding buyers .

La gommeuse achieved the top price of $ 67.5m ( £45m ) at sotheby 's , as part of their impressionist & modern art sale on thursday . And van gogh 's atmospheric landscape , paysage sous un ciel mouvemente , sold for $ 54m ( £36m ) , helping to take the evening 's total to $ 306.7m ( £203m ) . Simon shaw , co-head of impressionist and modern art worldwide , called it `` a small sale that packed a real punch '' . He added : `` each season picasso has the remarkable ability to surprise , and tonight was no exception , with the unusual appearance of two blue period works , which set new benchmarks - both in oil and on paper . '' La gommeuse , described as most the important blue period picasso to come to the market in a generation , was painted in 1901 . The portrait is of a nude unnamed woman . Gommeuse , which translates into english as'gummy ' was a sexually charged slang word of the time for cafe-concert singers and their songs . It features a second portrait on the reverse of the canvas , which was hidden for a century until its discovery in 2000 during conservation work . The caricature of picasso 's friend pere manach was apparently intended as a gift for the catalan anarchist who shared the artist 's studio flat in the boulevard de clichy in paris . The painting was one of 47 works on offer , with just over three-quarters finding buyers .

Six authorities have told bbc wales a meltdown in waste markets has hit their budgets . Pembrokeshire council has seen the price it gets for steel drop by 88 % over the year - while flintshire has seen the price for plastics halved . Experts say a slump in oil prices , cheap steel imports , and china 's economic slowdown are to blame . `` we try to play the markets as best we can , '' harvey mitchell , the waste services manager for flintshire , said . `` it makes it difficult when we do have a drop in issues we ca n't control , such as the global price of oil , or when larger countries flood the european market with steel . '' Flintshire has been celebrating a record year for recycling household waste - up to 58 % of everything thrown away now ends up at its waste recover facility in buckley . `` but while we 've seen an increase in the amount of material we 've collected , we 've actually seen a drop in the income because of the market prices , '' mr mitchell said . Recycled waste netted the council £537,000 in revenue in 2015/16 , but this represented a drop of 45 % in the expected income - more than £400,000 in lost cash . The pattern has been repeated in pembrokeshire , where £360,000 has been wiped off the council 's expected income , while four other councils saw a combined drop of £335,000 . `` this is an issue which is impacting upon wales as a whole , not just pembrokeshire , '' a council official there said . `` fortunately quotes for the coming months are starting to look more positive with prices starting to increase . '' The impact on most of the other welsh councils which responded to bbc wales has been minimal , as they said are tied into long term contracts dealing with their recycling services . But one academic expert said authorities and the public in wales will need to refocus as they face ever increasing targets on recycling . By 2025 welsh authorities are being asked to recycle 70 % of waste - by 2050 , it should be 100 % . `` waste prevention is what this is all about , '' rebecca colley-jones , from bangor university 's sustainability lab , said . `` it 's about buying smartly , being able to think about what you do with it so it can be reused , because reuse is a form of waste prevention . `` together we can provide solutions for the future .

The woman , named only as uzma , was escorted across the wagah border by indian high commission officials . She has accused her husband , tahir ali , of torturing her . He denies the allegations . The incident comes amid increasing tension between india and pakistan . On thursday , india 's foreign minister sushma swaraj tweeted , welcoming her return : . Pakistani security officials escorted uzma , who is in her early 20s , to the border crossing in the morning . She arrived in delhi later in the day . Uzma 's return comes as india and pakistan trade accusations over violence in disputed kashmir , territory which both countries claim . Tensions also rose after pakistan sentenced an indian national , kulbhushan jadhav , to death on charges of spying . On her arrival in delhi , uzma described pakistan as `` a death trap '' . `` i 've seen women who go there after arranged marriages . They 're miserable and living in terrible circumstances . There 're two , three , even four wives in every house , '' she told a press conference . `` if i 'd remained there for a few days more , i would have died . '' Uzma met tahir ali in malaysia and fell in love with him , according to reports . She then travelled to pakistan earlier this month where , she said , she was forced into marriage on 3 may . While there is enough evidence to suggest that uzma came to pakistan of her own accord , it remains unclear why she changed her mind . Tahir ali has said that his father sponsored uzma 's visa for pakistan after the couple met in malaysia and decided to get married . Uzma 's contention that she was married at `` gunpoint '' sits uneasily against the fact that she , along with mr ali and his relatives , had visited a district court in buner town to get married . The official who performed the wedding says she appeared to participate willingly in the ceremony . Mr ali has alleged that indian officials at the high commission forced her to change her mind . On 12 may , uzma filed an appeal in the islamabad high court , accusing her husband of harassing and intimidating her , and taking away her travel documents to stop her from leaving pakistan . She told the court that he had not told her that he was a married father of four and that she had been `` terribly beaten ... tortured physically and mentally '' . Uzma also has a five-year-old daughter from an earlier marriage . Her lawyer requested that the court should allow her to go back to india , saying her daughter was thalassaemic and needed daily blood transfusions . Mr ali told bbc 's m ilyas khan in islamabad that the charges against him were false - he said she had known about his marital status and was `` disappointed '' that he was not allowed to speak to her under court 's supervision . He said he was `` confident '' that she would get in touch with him once the dust had settled .",

If confirmed by the senate , james comey will replace outgoing director robert mueller iii , serving for 10 years . At the white house , mr obama praised mr comey as a model of `` fierce independence and deep integrity '' . Mr comey is known for successfully opposing a warrantless wiretapping programme backed by other bush aides . Mr mueller took up his post shortly before the 9/11 attacks and is retiring as director on 4 september . In remarks on friday , mr obama said the outgoing director had displayed `` a steady hand and strong leadership '' during his time at the head of the fbi . The us president said mr comey had `` law enforcement in his blood '' . `` as a young prosecutor in the us attorney 's office in manhattan he helped bring down the gambino crime family ; as a federal prosecutor in virginia he led an aggressive effort to combat gun violence that reduced homicide rates and saved lives , '' mr obama said . He also joked that mr comey - who is 6ft , 8in tall ( 2.03m ) - was `` a man who stands up very tall for justice and the rule of law '' . The nominee said he could not describe his excitement to work again with the fbi . `` they are men and women who have devoted their lives to serving and protecting others and i simply ca n't wait to be their colleague , '' he said . One of the most dramatic episodes of mr comey 's tenure as deputy attorney general in the bush administration came in 2004 , when then-attorney general john ashcroft was ill in hospital . Mr bush 's white house counsel alberto gonzales and chief of staff andrew card pressed him in his hospital bed to re-authorise a controversial programme allowing federal agents to eavesdrop on phone conversations without a warrant . Mr comey , who was acting as attorney general in mr ashcroft 's stead , rushed to the hospital and intervened . Changes were subsequently made to the programme and mr comey drew wide praise . Mr obama alluded to the incident on friday , saying mr comey `` was prepared to give up a job he loved rather than be part of something he felt was fundamentally wrong '' . After leaving the bush administration , mr comey was general counsel for bridgewater associates , a hedge fund in the us state of connecticut .

        "source": "Rail ticket machines cause so much confusion that one-fifth of passengers who use them buy the wrong ticket , according to the rail regulator . While 7 % of people underpay and could be fined , 13 % are paying too much . The office of rail and road ( orr ) wants train companies to refund passengers who accidentally buy tickets that are too expensive for their journey . Train operators said that vending machines were designed for simple ticket requirements . They say plans to simplify fares will help them to give clearer information on ticket machines . The orr employed mystery shoppers to buy rail tickets from machines . `` despite investment in new technology and the removal of jargon from ticket machines , our new research shows passengers may be paying more for their journey than necessary , '' said john larkinson , orr director of railway markets and economics . `` we are calling on train companies to commit to refund anyone who finds that they could have bought a cheaper ticket for the same journey , '' he added . Rail operators c2c and scotrail already have a price guarantee in place for when passengers overpay . Earlier this month , the rail delivery group ( rdg ) , which represents train operators , announced a trial scheme to simplify fares . It said the 16 million fares on offer were `` baffling '' for passengers . As part of the trial , which begins in may , ticket machines on stations will also be updated , to make sure they show the cheapest fares available . `` to quickly benefit passengers , the rail delivery group must set out what improvements to ticket machines will be made in the short term , '' said mr larkinson . Paul plummer , chief executive of the rdg , told the bbc that operators were aware that there was a problem with machines , and that they had formulated a 10-point plan to improve them . Yet he pointed out the machines were designed as `` queue-busters '' for passengers with relatively simple requirements , but `` expectations [ of passengers ] had evolved '' . He said that the system of fares was far too complicated . The rdg also added : `` complex , decades-old government rail fare regulations make it more difficult for train companies to offer the right , simple options on ticket machines . `` simplifying the number and types of fares in the system will let train companies provide customers with clear information and help them to make better informed choices , '' they added . By ben morris , business reporter . In the british rail era , rail fares were a relatively simple affair , with ticket prices worked out on a cost-per mile basis . But in the 1990s , in an effort to make the network more efficient , the operation of rail services was handed to private train operating companies ( tocs ) . The tocs were given some freedom to set ticket prices , with advanced ticket bookings particularly important to them , as it helps them to keep their trains full . To protect passengers , other fares were regulated , including season tickets and off-peak fares . The result is a patchwork of fares , that becomes even more complicated when a passenger wants to cross several train regions . Savvy travellers have been taking advantage of this by splitting their journey into several tickets , rather than one through-ticket .",

It said the 16 million fares on offer were `` baffling '' for passengers . As part of the trial , which begins in may , ticket machines on stations will also be updated , to make sure they show the cheapest fares available . `` to quickly benefit passengers , the rail delivery group must set out what improvements to ticket machines will be made in the short term , '' said mr larkinson . Paul plummer , chief executive of the rdg , told the bbc that operators were aware that there was a problem with machines , and that they had formulated a 10-point plan to improve them . Yet he pointed out the machines were designed as `` queue-busters '' for passengers with relatively simple requirements , but `` expectations [ of passengers ] had evolved '' . He said that the system of fares was far too complicated . The rdg also added : `` complex , decades-old government rail fare regulations make it more difficult for train companies to offer the right , simple options on ticket machines . `` simplifying the number and types of fares in the system will let train companies provide customers with clear information and help them to make better informed choices , '' they added . By ben morris , business reporter . In the british rail era , rail fares were a relatively simple affair , with ticket prices worked out on a cost-per mile basis . But in the 1990s , in an effort to make the network more efficient , the operation of rail services was handed to private train operating companies ( tocs ) . The tocs were given some freedom to set ticket prices , with advanced ticket bookings particularly important to them , as it helps them to keep their trains full . To protect passengers , other fares were regulated , including season tickets and off-peak fares . The result is a patchwork of fares , that becomes even more complicated when a passenger wants to cross several train regions . Savvy travellers have been taking advantage of this by splitting their journey into several tickets , rather than one through-ticket .",

That has prompted a debate with calls for the introduction of a charge on homes to pay for improvements in infrastructure . Now , the european commission has opened a so-called `` pilot case '' to look at the issue . Essentially , this is a way for the commission to establish whether eu rules are being correctly applied . It allows for the commission and member states to resolve any conflicts without resorting to infringement proceedings .

Wales 's first commercial tidal energy farm is due to launch off anglesey in summer 2016 . Its electricity generators will operate like wind turbines but with blades driven by tidal wave action . Menter mon and wave hub were confirmed by the crown estate as managers for the west anglesey tidal and south pembrokeshire wave demonstration zones respectively . They will prepare and manage the sites for sub-letting to developers . In addition , development rights for a tidal site off holyhead deep have been granted to minesto . Rob hastings , director of energy and infrastructure at the crown estate said : `` by providing these additional seabed rights we are pleased to be enabling further technology development and commercialisation , which will be critical if the uk is to unlock its significant natural resources for wave and tidal current energy . `` this innovative approach to leasing the seabed sees us responding to market demand and introducing managed demonstration zones to give other organisations the opportunity to lend tangible support in their local areas . '' First minster carwyn jones said : `` the energetic waters off our coast are ideal for marine renewable energy projects . `` our ports , supply-chain infrastructure and grid infrastructure also put us in an enviable position for developing a thriving marine energy market , both as a significant generator and as an exporter of marine energy knowledge , technologies and services .

First minister carwyn jones said the benefits could be significant in terms of the economy and renewable energy . Wales 's first commercial tidal energy farm is due to launch off anglesey in summer 2016 . Its electricity generators will operate like wind turbines but with blades driven by tidal wave action . Menter mon and wave hub were confirmed by the crown estate as managers for the west anglesey tidal and south pembrokeshire wave demonstration zones respectively . They will prepare and manage the sites for sub-letting to developers . In addition , development rights for a tidal site off holyhead deep have been granted to minesto . Rob hastings , director of energy and infrastructure at the crown estate said : `` by providing these additional seabed rights we are pleased to be enabling further technology development and commercialisation , which will be critical if the uk is to unlock its significant natural resources for wave and tidal current energy . `` this innovative approach to leasing the seabed sees us responding to market demand and introducing managed demonstration zones to give other organisations the opportunity to lend tangible support in their local areas . '' First minster carwyn jones said : `` the energetic waters off our coast are ideal for marine renewable energy projects . `` our ports , supply-chain infrastructure and grid infrastructure also put us in an enviable position for developing a thriving marine energy market , both as a significant generator and as an exporter of marine energy knowledge , technologies and services . '' Gareth clubb , director of friends of the earth cymru said : `` to having testing sites approved for marine renewable energy is a significant step forward . ''",

Now the welsh secretary has pledged to keep wales at the discussion table on the future of devolved powers across britain .

The meeting is likely to take place when parliament returns next month . He said he is also arranging meetings with party leaders in the national assembly to ensure their views feed into the debate .
